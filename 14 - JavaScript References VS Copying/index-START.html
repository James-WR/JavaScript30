    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players2 = players
    console.log(players2);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players2[1] = "James";
    console.log(players2);
    console.log(players);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    players3 = players.splice()
    console.log(players3);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    players4 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players4);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    players5 = [...players];
    console.log(players5);

    // or:
    players6 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(players6);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 40
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({},person, {height: 193});
    console.log(person2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person3 = {...person}
    console.log(person3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
